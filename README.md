### Introduction

The Sanity Engine is an AI engine for the [Unity Game Editor][1]. The goal of the engine is to provide easy access to common AI algorithms and techniques through Unity components and scripts.

### Getting Started

To start using the project, you can simply clone the git repository into your project’s `Assets` folder. The next time you open your project, or once Unity notices the directory has changed, the project should be imported into your Assets folder or any sub-folder within. If not, you may need to force a refresh. (See the [Unity documentation][2] for more information)

Once the SanityEngine folder is in your project, you can now use any of the components. For more information, see the [online resources][3].
